Get stl file from mail, slice it and put in uploads folder in octoprint.
Then update your google spreadsheet with the new input.

The autogcode.py is based on https://gist.github.com/jasonrdsouza/1674794 work, i just change it to my needs and updated some code.

The gsinput.py is a modification of the sample code given by Google https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python
